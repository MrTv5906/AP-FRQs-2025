# AP-FRQs-2025

*Solutions written by Kelvin Baez*

## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science exam taken on [Date]. While reviewing the released questions, I've documented my approach, insights gained, and areas for future growth.

## Exam Experience
In this section, I reflect on my overall experience taking the AP Computer Science exam:

- My preparation strategy for the exam included...
  - My Princeton Review book
  - Practice exams online
  - Understanding problems through Python Tutor
- The most challenging aspects of the exam were...
  - Time management
  - Quick reading comprehension for both code and explanations of the problem
- Time management techniques that worked well for me...
  - Pace myself with at most 2 minuets 20 seconds per problem
  - Spend little time perfecting every problem since every problem is worth the same points
  - Use extra time in the end to finish the harder problems
- Mental strategies I used when encountering difficult questions...
  - Filter out unessecary information
  - Understand what the question is asking and what answers are to be expected
  - Quickly factor out wrong answers by skimming through the code

## Growth Opportunities
Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning:

- Topic/Concept 1: Reading Comprehension
- Topic/Concept 2: FRQs
- Programming practice:
  - Class definition
  - Array lists

## Resources
Resources I found helpful during my exam preparation and review:

- Claude AI https://claude.ai/login?returnTo=%2F%3F
- Princeton Review Book https://www.amazon.com/Princeton-Review-Computer-Science-Prep/dp/0593450728
- Pyhton Tutor https://pythontutor.com/java.html#mode=edit

## Future Goals
Moving forward, I plan to:
- Start creating games using java and learn other coding languages
- Make small projects that function as very short and simplistic games to further my understanding of how I can use different coding methods to cerate different types of code.
- Use Python Tutor to gain a detailed understanding on how specific code works.
