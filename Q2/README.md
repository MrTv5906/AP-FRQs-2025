## Question 2 Analysis
### Signature

This section contains my analysis of Question 2 (Class Design):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- Understand what each method was used for
- See how the order of the signature affected the outcome
  
#### My revised solution after review:
- If and else statements made part B much easier
- Substring plays a large roll in the problem
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- Strings
- boolean statements
  
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- Strings are very flexible and can be easily altered with the use of code
