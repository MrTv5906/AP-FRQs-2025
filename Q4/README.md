## Question 4 Analysis
### SumOrSame Game Class

This section contains my analysis of Question 4 (2d Arrays):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- Understand how the board would be filled and what each cell represented
  
#### My revised solution after review:
- I started from the same row as the given number while skipping the given number
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
- Traversing 2d arrays
- boolean statements
  
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- The parameters given can have many possible outcomes on what is returned based on how the board looks
