## Question 1 Analysis
### Dog Walker

This section contains my analysis of Question 1 (Methods and Control Structures):

#### My initial approach during the exam:
- The 5 pages of details were daunting. I split each page into different sections to understand what each section was informing me about. Then I excluded less important info and kept the essential details which would help me understand and solve the problem.
  
#### My revised solution after review:
- I understood the question in much better detail when we reviewed it in class. This allowed me to understand what methods from each class should be implemented where.
  
#### Key concepts tested in this question:
  - class method definition
  - boolean expressions
  
#### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- I need to be much more careful when dealing with methods from seperate classes
